Exercise goals:

-	Construct branching narratives/non-linear narratives for interactive play using simple coding techniques (involving Twine, adapting HTML, CSS, etc.)
-	Practice creating different modes of interactivity through text and moving images
-	Think about different narrative structures (picaresque, gauntlet, quest, branch-and-bottleneck, etc.) 
-	Understand distinctions between “performance” and “performative”; critiquing types and effectiveness of interactivity

Instructions:
Using Twine, write a branching story with one or more of the following features:

1. Non-human (or better, non-animal) main character
2. Events out of chronological order
3. Multiple characters
4. Poem, not prose

Possibly avoid: life simulator, choose your own adventure tropes (walking around in a fictional world, fighting, dying etc.).

Requirements:
- Use the Twine non-linear story platform to create a game.
- You can use the downloaded or online version. If you use the online version, you will need to save your work by choosing the “Publish to File” option in the settings tab. This will download an .html file that can be opened on any computer.

## Game Analysis Presentation (Due: Week 4, 9.12.23-9.14.23)

Format: 
- 5-10 minutes long
- use Google Slides for images
- videos less than 30 seconds (short clips, please!)

The presentation should include:

- a short introduction: how did you find this game? Why does it appeal to you? What kind of game is this?
- a short explanation of how the game is played
- The analysis:

Choose three of the following of Sicart's game characteristics, and explain how your game fulfills (or thwarts!) them. 

1. Play is contextual. (6)
2. Play is carnivalesque. (11)
3. Play is appropriative. (11)
4. Play is disruptive. (14)
5. Play is autotelic. (16)
6. Play is creative. (17)
7. Play is personal. (17)

- Conclusion: is there anything you'd like to change about the game? Are there house rules you use, or rules/aspects of this game that you apply to other games?

Tips:

- Consider how language is used around the game (Huizinga, Chapter 2). How do people refer to the game (does it have particular words associated with it? Are there memes associated with it (consider "Among Us" and the word "sus", for example). Does the game have made up words or concepts? Does it have a specialized lingo associated with it?
- Consider how this game may have impacted history and/or culture (Huizinga, Chapter 3). Is there some larger concept that this game mimics/represents/parodies (example: Katamari Damacy is a commentary on capitalism).
