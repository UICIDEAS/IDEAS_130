### WHY A CAPSTONE? 
The IDEAS Capstone Project is typically pursued in the final two semesters at UIC, building upon the knowledge and skills acquired throughout the 
undergraduate years. To this end, all IDEAS majors enroll in a two-semester, sustained practicum that focuses on the production, discussion and 
theorization of subjects encountered throughout coursework in the College of Art, Design and Architecture (CADA) and the larger community of UIC. 
The Capstone may focus on a scholarly research or theory, creative visual or audio work, or design innovation or application. All projects develop 
professional skills, whether through rigorous inquiry, writing, crafting, or public presentation.  

IDEAS Capstone Projects challenge students to work independently or as a member of a team, develop critical and analytical skills, take risks, 
and see themselves as part of a global network of creatives, makers, activists, and thinkers.

## Attendance, Participation, and Zoom Expectations: 
This is a four-hour course, with 2 to 2.5 contact hours per week in the form of Tuesday class meetings. You should expect to read, watch, or listen 
to around 2 hours of required course materials per week, in addition to the time it will take to complete assignments.

Another important component to our class will be personal capstone websites, 
procured through the [UIC Digital Humanities Initiative](https://dhi.uic.edu/). This website will facilitate project management, workshop ideas, and 
track our progress. Part of attendance will also count occasional one-on-one meetings (either in person or via Zoom) that will take place throughout 
the semester. If for any reason you cannot attend—technical issues, health (both physical and mental), etc.—please let me know (tfunk4@uic.edu). 
Be aware that there is a [resources](RESOURCES.md) page that includes helpful information regarding laptop borrowing and hotspot checkout via ACCC.
